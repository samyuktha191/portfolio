A company has two separate systems:
System1- Attendance system: It stores employee daily check-in & check-outs timings.
System2- Payroll system: It stores monthly salary, bonuses, and deductions.
The HR team wants a dashboard to answer questions like below...
How many employees are present on a given day?
What is the average number of hours worked per employee per month and week?
Which employees had the highest working hours?
Cross-check salary payouts with actual attendance.
